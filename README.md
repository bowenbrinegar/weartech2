### Summary of Market Gap:

In a world of products, it is hard to narrow down what layer of the market to go after. Some products are better at the consumer level, while others are more advantageous at the industry level. We are going after the Healthcare industry and corporations that offers services to the public within that category.

We have found that there have been problems related to wheelchair cushions and bed springs wearing out, only to be replaced years after their expiration. Our solution is to put $1 sensors into the products listed above that help communicate when assets need to be replaced, thus prevent any poor health outcomes related to expired and weared gear.


### Summary of Solution:

Our solution to these sensors is to create an interactive administrative portal to recognize changes in quality in real time, allowing organization to act responsively to the needs of their consumers. The application will feature abilities to add, replace, and inspect sensors within a given network. Give real time overview stats on an organization's outlook, and give insight into how other institutions are operating under the same system formation.


### Mission of Website:

The goal of the website is outreach, application, and transparency. We hope that our buyers and their buyers know what’s going on behind the scenes and how well issue response is regulated throughout our brands implementation.
